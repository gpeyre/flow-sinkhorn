This repository contains the reference implementation of the **Flow Sinkhorn** algorithm.

The algorithm is introduced and analyzed in the paper:

> **Robust Sublinear Convergence Rates for Iterative Bregman Projections on Affine Spaces**  
> Gabriel Peyré  
> *arXiv preprint, 2026*

Flow Sinkhorn can be seen as a flow-based interpretation and implementation of Sinkhorn-type iterations, with strong robustness and convergence guarantees derived from the theory of iterative Bregman projections.

## 🚀 Quick start (Colab)

An interactive notebook demonstrating the **implementation and showcasing of the algorithm** is available here:

**[Open the notebook in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/gpeyre/flow-sinkhorn/blob/main/code/flow-sinkhorn.ipynb)**

The notebook walks through:
- the core ideas behind Flow Sinkhorn,
- a clean implementation of the algorithm,
- illustrative numerical experiments.
